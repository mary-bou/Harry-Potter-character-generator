# Harry Potter character generator

This code creates a button that, when clicked, generates a random Harry Potter character by selecting a random house, first name, and last name from predefined arrays. The character's full name and house are displayed in a paragraph element with the id "character". The `generateCharacter` function is called when the button is clicked, and it selects random values from the arrays and concatenates them to form the character's name and house.
